# GameOfThrones

Welcome to Game Of Thrones!  

This is a tongue-in-cheek CLI guessing game that uses toilets manufactured by - and published on the
website of - Kohler International.

After launching the program you will receive instructions and prompts for CLI navigation and gameplay.

Remember: In the game of thrones, you either win, or you die! :p

Good Luck!
